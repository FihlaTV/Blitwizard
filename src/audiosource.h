struct audiosource {
    // Read data:
    int (*read)(struct audiosource* source, char* buffer, unsigned int bytes);
    // Writes 0 to bytes to the buffer pointer.
    // Returns the amount of bytes written.
    // When -1 is returned, an error occured (the buffer is left untouched).
    // When 0 is returned, the end of the source is reached.
    // In case of 0/-1, you should close the audio resource.

    // Seek:
    int (*seek)(struct audiosource* source, size_t pos);
    // Seek to the given sample position.
    // Returns 0 when seeking fails, 1 when seeking succeeds.

    // Pos:
    size_t (*position)(struct audiosource* source);
    // Get the current playback position in the stream in samples.

    // Rewind:
    void (*rewind)(struct audiosource* source);
    // Rewind and start over from the beginning.
    // This can be used any time as long as read has never returned
    // an error (-1).
    // Some streams will support rewind, whereas seeking is not supported.

    // Query stream length:
    size_t (*length)(struct audiosource* source);
    // Query the total song length. Returns length in total samples
    // (it doesn't count one sample per channel but one for all, so
    // 48kHz audio will always have 48000 samples per second, no matter if
    // mono or stereo or something else)
    // If you need the length in seconds, divide this through the samplerate.
    // Returns 0 if peeking at length is not supported or length is unknown.

    // Close audio source:
    void (*close)(struct audiosource* source);
    // Closes the audio source and frees this struct and all data.

    // Audio sample rate:
    unsigned int samplerate;
    // This is set to the audio sample rate.
    // Format is always 32bit signed float stereo if not specified.
    // Set to 0 for unknown or encoded (ogg) formats

    // Channels:
    unsigned int channels;
    // This is set to the audio channels.
    // Set to 0 for unknown or encoded (ogg) formats

    // Audio sample format:
    unsigned int format;
    // This is set to the sample format.

    // Supports seeking:
    int seekable;
    // Set to 1 if seeking support is available, otherwise 0.
