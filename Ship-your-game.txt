To ship your game based on blitwizard, simply combine your game files
(your game.lua and other used scripts and the artwork you use) with the
blitwizard binary (e.g. the windows .exe) and the templates folder.

For adhering to the third-party library licenses, you will probably
need to ship some of the README-* files among other things.
See note at the bottom of the page at

Also a question that might be commonly asked:
Do you need to pay for distributing with and using blitwizard for games,
even if they're commercial? No, you don't :)
