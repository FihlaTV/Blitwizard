To ship your game based on blitwizard, simply combine your game files
(your game.lua and other used scripts and the artwork you use) with the
blitwizard binary (e.g. the windows .exe) and the templates folder.

I strongly suggest you include README-libs.txt aswell, see note at the bottom
of the page http://games.homeofjones.de/blitwizard/

Also a question that might be commonly asked:
Do you need to pay for distributing with and using blitwizard for games,
even if they're commercial? No, you don't :)
