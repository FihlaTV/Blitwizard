// Run script:

int luastate_DoInitialFile(const char* file, int argcount, char** error);

// Misc:

char* luastate_GetPreferredAudioBackend();
int luastate_GetWantFFmpeg();
void luastate_PrintStackDebug();
void luastate_SetGCCallback(void* luastate, int tablestackindex, int (*callback)(void*));
void luastate_GCCollect();
void* luastate_GetStatePtr(); // pointer of the lua state
void* internaltracebackfunc(); // function pointer of traceback function

// Call functions:

// Arguments:
int luastate_PushFunctionArgumentToMainstate_Bool(int yesno); // 1: success, 0: failure (out of memory)
int luastate_PushFunctionArgumentToMainstate_String(const char* string); // 1: success, 0: failure (out of memory)
int luastate_PushFunctionArgumentToMainstate_Double(double i); // 1: success, 0: failure (out of memory)
// Function call:
int luastate_CallFunctionInMainstate(const char* function, int args, int recursivetablelookup, int allownil, char** error, int* functiondidnotexist); // 1: success, 0: failure
// *error will be either changed to NULL or to an error string - NULL means most likely out of memory)
// allownil set to 1 will only report failure when the function existed and ran into an error, if it simply didn't exist at all it will report sucess.
// If allownil is 1 and functiondidnotexist is not NULL, *functiondidnotexist will be set to 1 if the function did not exist (and success was reported). If the function actually existed (no matter whether the call succeeded or not), it will be left untouched
