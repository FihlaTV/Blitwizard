uint64_t time_GetMilliseconds(void);
// Timestamp derived from SDL_GetTicks(),
// but deals with wraps (SDL_GetTicks() is originally
// an uint32_t).
//
// When a wrap happens, it is detected and the time is
// forced to proceed from the last returned value + 1.
//
// This results in an inaccurate time returned when
//  a wrap happens relative to the previous time stamp
// returned, but the time will never wrap/suddenly
// jump backwards until uint64_t is exceeded.

uint64_t time_GetMicroseconds(void);
// Time which has passed in micro seconds since an undefined
// point in time (e.g. program start).
//
// Please note this is unimplemented on some systems
// (returns always 0).

void time_Sleep(uint32_t milliseconds);
// Sleep for a specified amount of time.
