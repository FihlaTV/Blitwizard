- Blitwizard README -

You got blitwizard at your hands, a 2d engine that runs Lua scripts
you write to specify the behaviour of your game/multimedia application.

If you don't have a binary release, you need to build blitwizard first.
Please check out README-build.txt for this.

If you have the binary release or succeeded in compilation, simply
enter the bin/ sub folder and run blitwizard in there to get the
sample browser to see a few simple examples on how to use blitwizard.

You can check out the example source code by opening the .lua files
of the examples which are located in examples/ in separate sub
folders. Feel free to modify those .lua files, then rerun the sample
browser and see how the examples changed!

Please check out docs/api.html for a complete documentation of the
provided functionality of blitwizard for advanced usage.
