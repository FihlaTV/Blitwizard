To ship your game based on blitwizard, simply combine your game files
(your game.lua and other used scripts and the artwork you use) with the
blitwizard binary (e.g. the windows .exe) and the templates folder.

So all you need to ship is:

 - blitwizard.exe or/and other platform's blitwizard binary
 - templates/ folder (all contents)
 - game.lua from your game and other files of your game (images etc)
 - README-libs.txt for licensing (see NOTE below)

If you ship more, in particularly FFmpeg, read the FFmpeg section below.

Disclaimer:
  While I wrote some README files and point them out here for use to comply
  with third-party library licensing, I am not a lawyer.
  It is your own responsibility to make sure that you comply with the third
  party libraries' licenses and any things like patents.

Read http://games.homeofjones.de/blitwizard/#third-party_licensing
The FFmpeg paragraph only applies if you ship FFmpeg.

FOR FFMPEG:
 If you ship FFmpeg additionally (libavformat/libavcodec), please make
 sure you read the third party licensing notes above on FFmpeg!
 Adhere to them, or the FFmpeg devs might get angry.

 FFmpeg is also subject to patents and other things in many countries,
 so you might need to pay various patent fees. It is up to you to figure
 this out (see http://ffmpeg.org/).

 The following parts are part of FFmpeg (for win32 blitwizard):
  libavformat.dll - part of FFmpeg lib
  libavcodec.dll - part of FFmpeg lib
  ffmpeg-*.tar.bz2 - FFmpeg source tar ball, for licensing compliance, see NOTE above
  README-lgpl.txt - license and copyright info file, for licensing compliance
  README-ffmpeg.txt - license and copyright info file, for licensing compliance
 
 The non-win32 blitwizard releases come without FFmpeg and you
 need to obtain it yourself and ship it with your game if you
 are interested in doing that.
